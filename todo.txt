Test the code
Initialize the LSTM with Orthogonal (remove connections from cell to gates)
Check the warning saying that we are not learning on all the parameters of the model
Make a google doc for the ran experiments (and all the setups)
Add regularization?
Add some fancy extensions? Decrease learning_rate when training...
